# Change - Nonprofit Donation

## Thought Process
First, I decided to do some research into why a company might donate to a nonprofit. Before I started to program the features, I narrowed a few key assumptions I make from the research I conducted:

* Companies may want nonprofits that <u>**support their mission**</u>

* From a marketing perspective, companies are attempting to <u>**build their social image**</u>, so their decision may be based on **current news**

* A company may be looking for a <u>**specific tax credit**</u> or benefit

From this information, I decided to create a ___________________. 

Next, I poured through Change's Existing Documentation from which I found the APIs.
